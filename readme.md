# Standalone Application Router, Using HTML5 Application Repository with UI5 Web Components, XSUAA Service, and Destination Service 

## Diagram

![diagram](diagram.png)

## Description
This is an example of an HTML5 app built with UI5 Web Components that you maintain on a standalone application router in your own space in the Cloud Foundry environment. The app is deployed to the HTML5 Application Repository and uses the Authentication & Authorization service (XSUAA service), the destination service, and the User API service.


## Download and Installation
1. Download the source code:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/multi-cloud-html5-apps-samples
    cd multi-cloud-html5-apps-samples/standalone-approuter-html5-mta-ui5webcomponents
    ```
2. Build the project:
    ```
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
3. Deploy the project:
    ```
    cf deploy mta_archives/standalone-approuter-ui5webcomponents_1.0.0.mtar
    ```

If the deployment has been successful, you find the URL of the application router in the console output or you can print it on Unix-based systems with `cf app approuter | awk '/^routes/ { print "https://"$2"/" }'`. It probably has the following structure: <https://[cf-org-name]-dev-approuter.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com>.


## Configuration

You can replace the content of the `ui5webcomponents` folder with your own HTML5 app. Please note that the `html5deployer` expects a zipped version of your build result (in our case the build result is our `dist` folder). Check the build script at [`package.json`](ui5webcomponents/package.json) to see an example of that. Keep in mind that your app id in the `manifest.json` has to match the target for path `^(.*)` (all incoming requests) in the [`xs-app.json`](approuter/xs-app.json).
